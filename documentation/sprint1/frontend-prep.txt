1.  add navigation structure & add styling and basic interactivity
2.  I need to add a bottom navigation bar for the home page, diet page, and exercise, skin/hair care page,
    notification page, and the account page.
    I need to style the pages.
3.  I first need to create the different pages/screens for each tab
    that I plan to add. for example the home page, diet page etc.
    Then i need to add icons at the bottom of the screen for the mobile tabs.
    and have them serve as links to navigate to the different pages I will create.
    I will also have to style the pages such as changing background colors chaning font size, the size of the mobile tab icons so they all fit on the screen.
    I expect to edit the wireframe page.
    Done will look like a landing page where you will be able to click on any of the 
    mobile tabs and where you will be able to navigate to whichever one you like.
4.  What might block me is how I will create the frontend pages using android studio or through vscode. Im not 
    entirely sure which to use.
    I will need what type of data to display on each page from the database teammate.
