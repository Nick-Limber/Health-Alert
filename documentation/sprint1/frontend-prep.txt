1. What you are responsible for in Sprint 1
• List the Trello cards you own
I own the Build landing page layout, which includes the home-screen page
and follows layout of wireframe. I am also sharing the Add styling and basic
interactivity card with Porfirio.


2. Setup steps
• Step by step instructions for what you need to install, configure, or create
• Include commands, links, or screenshots if needed
I need to create a HTML file and a CSS file for the home page.
We are using Andriod and Firebase.


3. Development plan
• Step by step plan for how you will build your cards this sprint
• Include what files you expect to create or edit
• Include what “done” looks like
I will build my cards by following the wireframe for the homepage.
I expect to have two files, one for HTML and one for CSS so far.
Done will look like home-screen page that has consistent colors/images/pictures.
Done is:
• A working landing/home/default page
• Visual structure that matches your wireframes
• Initial styling choices applied
• Some form of interactivity or JavaScript logic


4. Risks or questions
• What might block you
• What you need from teammates
I need to have clear, consistent communication with everyone
involved in the frontend parts so there are no misunderstandings.
